# Inventory Management System

A full-stack inventory management system with a Node.js/Express backend and React frontend.

## Features

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **User Management**: Registration, login, profile management with role-based access (admin, staff, supplier, driver)
- **Product Management**: Create, read, update, delete products with categories, pricing, and stock tracking
- **Inventory Management**: Manage multiple inventories, track capacity utilization, cost summaries
- **Transportation**: Track deliveries and transportation status
- **Storage Management**: Manage storage units with capacity and temperature controls
- **Wage Management**: Calculate wages, track work hours, identify overworked employees
- **Alerts System**: System alerts and notifications
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with cookies

### Frontend (React)
- **Clean, Minimal UI**: Boxy design with structured containers, no graphics/illustrations
- **Dashboard**: Overview of products, inventories, users, and alerts
- **Product Management**: Full CRUD operations with search and filtering
- **Inventory Management**: Detailed inventory views with product assignments
- **User Management**: View and manage system users (admin only)
- **Transportation Tracking**: View delivery status and transportation records with safe location rendering
- **Storage Management**: Manage storage units and capacity
- **Wage Management**: View wages and overworked employees
- **Alerts**: View system alerts and trigger test alerts
- **Profile Management**: Update profile and change password
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Safe Object Rendering**: Properly handles complex data structures (GeoJSON locations) without React rendering errors

## Important Notes

### Location Data Handling
The transportation system uses GeoJSON Point objects for location data, which are automatically converted to readable coordinate strings in the UI to prevent React rendering errors. The system safely handles various location formats including:
- GeoJSON Point objects with coordinates
- String addresses
- Location objects with city/state properties
- Empty or undefined location data

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js & Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Winston for logging
- Zod for validation
- CORS enabled

### Frontend
- React 18
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls
- Context API for state management
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- npm

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:4444`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`
